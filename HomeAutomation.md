# Home Automation

This is a fairly big subject in itself, my research done for the past year boils down to three (but really, two) technologies that are not mutually exlcusive:

Matter and Zigbee.

## Zigbee

By far the most plug-and-play 

## Matter

Matter is a new spec for intercommunication between smart things. It should be possible for any device to be matter compatible with a software update, but that depends on the company to properlly support it. Matter basically ensures you can use any hardware be it of any brand with any software. For the actual wireless network matter can use, it can be anything, from bluetooth to wifi, but the best tech that is kinda agreed upon by everyone for this is [thread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(network_protocol)), which is a networking protocol. The matter alliance is kinda led by the zigbee alliance, so it feels like its natural evolution.
